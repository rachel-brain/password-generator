# Random Password Generator

This Password Generator will generate as many passwords as a user needs, based on their choice of criteria selected from lowercase, uppercase, numbers & special characters plus the password length they want.  A brief section has been added to the page so that the user understands the importance of using a random mix of characters & a longer length to ensure a strong & secure password.


# Steps

1. The user clicks on the big green 'Generate Password' button.
2. A series of confirm & prompt buttons are presented asking the user to choose the criteria for their password.
3. The user responds to all of these & a random password is generated meeting all the chosen criteria.
4. If the user does not fulfil the requirements of the generator (such as choosing at least one type of character or a password length between 8 & 128 characters), then relevant messages are shown & the user can begin again.
5. Once the password is generated, the user can copy the password & run through the steps again to generate as many passwords as required.
